# React
### This repository is just for the process of me self-learning React.
### Including some demo for basics and some real practices of building components using Reactã€‚
***Wish I could have a pleasant journey of learning React :)***

#### Before 1/12/2022

1. some basic concept

#### 1/12/2022

1. create react app using npm 
```shortcuts
rsf -> create a function component
rcc -> create a class component
```

#### 2/12/2022

1. Completed a simple todo list app
2. But I was stuck on function callbacks for the whole night LOL **>_<** So here are some tips for callbacks in React:
   1. If the function is **directly called** from event handlers **with parameters,** or you want to have access to the event, the function should be higher-order function
   2. That's probably it... Maybe I will come back for other cases in terms of the callbacks

#### 3/12/2022 - 6/12/2022

1. Literally did noting but resting and was going through a shoulder strain which fxxked me up..
2. Went for k.dot's concert on Monday (5/12/2022). And that was sooooo fucking dope!
3. Will continue on React starting from 7/12/2022.
