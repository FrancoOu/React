1. Completed a simple todo list app
2. But I was stuck on function callbacks for the whole night LOL **>_<** So here is some tips for callbacks in React:
   1. If the function is **directly called** from event handlers **with parameters,** or you want to have access to the event, the function should be higher-order function
   2. That's probably it... Maybe I will come back for other cases in terms of the callbacks
